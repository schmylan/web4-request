Can I use your name?

Hello @web4 . I'm getting ready to rename this [Xui](https://github.com/xui/xui) project. It's turned into something kinda interesting - manipulating HTML's DOM with any language, not just JavaScript. Since the execution context runs outside the JS sandbox, as an unintended consequence, it promotes reactivity to be an HTML-level primitive - no more JS frameworks necessary.

I'd love to change the name of the project to Web4 as a GitHub organization. I currently have the domain name web4.dev and the GitHub org /web4foundation but /web4 would be substantially better. Are you using the name for anything? If not, could I please make use of it?

I've been working on it consistently for the past 3 years and if you're curious to learn more I wrote 13 essays at https://rylan.io . Feel free to email me directly at rylan@barn.es if you prefer.
